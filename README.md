# Tier 1 Week 3

This week, we will continue to put more into your tool belt by tackling ways to: 

- handle tasks that repeat multiple times (loops: `for`, `while`, `for of`)
- store multiple pieces of information (arrays)

**REMINDER:** Make sure to answer the Slack discussion question for this week!

## Getting Started

As always, start off by forking and cloning this repository from GitHub. Open the code up in Atom to get started.

Remember `console.log()` is your friend and you can use it in conjunction with the browser console to see the output of your code as you go.

**NOTE:** The *.js* and *.css* files are already sourced into *index.html*.

### Reminder - Levels of Difficulty

- Required Features are required and focus on the key skills for the week
- Stretch Goals are __*optional*__!
  - These will stretch and challenge deeper understanding of the material.
  - Note that these may require additional research beyond the provided content. 

## Part 1 - Arrays Practice
Complete the `1-array-practice.js` file. 

In this file there are some examples of working with arrays followed by TODO comments with tasks for you to complete. 

> Please do not remove the instruction comments as you complete your work. 

## Part 2 - Loops Practice
Complete the `2-loops-practice.js` file. 

This file also contains TODO comments with tasks for you to complete. 

> Again, please do not remove the instruction comments. 

## Part 3 - Part Supply
Complete the `3-part-supply.js` file. 

This part of the assignment will mix more of the array and loop content with more of the material from earlier weeks. Again, there are comments with instructions for completing each task. 

> Again, please do not remove the instruction comments. 

## CSS + HTML
Feel free to write questions in the HTML file!
Check the CSS file for a small todo!

## Assignment Submission
Check in your repo, then turn in your work via the Prime Academy Assignment Application at http://primeacademy.io, as usual and don't hesitate to hit up the Slack channel as needed!

This week has 3 assignments in the Portal for this repo. Turn in this one repo for each of the assignments. (Yes, same repo link to all 3).
This is so you can receive separate feedback for each section.

**Make sure that you answer this week's discussion question in Slack!**
